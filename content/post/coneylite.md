**Hey there!** You either stumbled upon this article because I threw it in your face when you asked, or you found it from my server. Either way, welcome!

This guide will attempt to guide you through the setup process. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. This should be applicable to other modpacks as well, so long as they're on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com).

I'll only be covering a MultiMC/PolyMC setup here, so if you're using another launcher, ask me in DMs.
<br>~~(Unless it's the CurseForge launcher, I'm not touching that with a 2 trillion foot pole...)~~

# Step 1: The JDK.

Getting this set up first will make the launcher setup go a lot smoother. __Be sure to get version 17.__

* On Windows, I recommend [this one](https://adoptium.net/). Be sure to use the installer if you can, it's a lot more convenient.
* On Linux, use your package manager to get version 17 of the OpenJDK. Most distros will have it.

# Step 2: The Launcher.

Next up... you gotta have the launcher!

I personally recommend PolyMC, as it comes as an installer.

* On Windows, simply install it like you would any other program, or download the portable version and extract it where you'd like.
* On Linux, see how it's packaged for your distro, the Flatpak version on Flathub is universal, however.

Then, start it up and run through the setup. If you installed the JDK properly from Step 1, you should see it get detected when it tries to pick a Java version to use.

After that, add an account, and you should be good to go!

# Step 3: The Modpack.

This is effectively the final step for a basic setup.

Go to **Add Instance**, click on the **Modrinth** category, and search **ConeyLite**. Simply download the latest version, and you should be ready to start!

# Extra info.

Please understand that I can't be responsible for whatever kind of setup you have that goes beyond the main list of mods you have installed.

However, if you do want to mess with the modlist, which is totally fine by me, simply go to **Edit Instance** on the side panel, and that'll give you easy access to every aspect of the modpack you'd want to mess with.

**If you have any questions, please either ask in my server, or shoot me a DM. Thank you!**
